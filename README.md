# Autonomous-Manual-Gripper-Robot
Given minimal components, my team member and I had to design a robot with the goal of picking up and gathering as many toy dinausaurs as possible within a two minute time frame. Extra points were awarded for being able to pick up and rescue a ken doll from a pit. Additionally, at the start of the two minutes the robot starts off in autonomous mode, where it has to navigate through a track, press a red button to unlock a gate, and drive through the gate. After this is completed, the robot can be manually controlled to start coralling the dinausaurs into a cage. For this project, my role included designing the robotic arm used to pick up the ken doll and the dinosaurs, assembling the electrical components, writing code for the autonomous and manual modes of the robot, and assembling the robot arm onto the base.
